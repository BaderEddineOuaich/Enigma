- DONE: Maybe ship Algorithm used in encryption with cipher? will be like (algo_enum_id + iv + cipher) so we can auto-detect algorithm used to encrypt buffer when decrypting. user may forget algorithm mode..
- DONE: Add Command line support (enigma --encrypt -mode=aes -infile=file outfil=...) 
- DONE: Support AES-GCM 
- DONE: (was imgui docking issue): Fix window on maximize, when dragging to centre it gets minimized
- DONE: Use GZip to compress file in CLI if user wanted.
- DONE: Use GZip to compress file in UI if user wanted. 
- Add memory usage next to title
When storing something particularly sensitive, perhaps archives of tax documents that
contain personal details like your social-security number, in online storage or emailing it
to someone, you may want to use encryption. Almost all of your personal files likely don't
require this sort of encryption, though.


- exclude catch sources on release & dist
