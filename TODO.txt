- Maybe ship Algorithm used in encryption with cipher? will be like (algo_enum_id + iv + cipher) so we can auto-detect algorithm used to encrypt buffer when decrypting. user may forget algorithm mode..
- Add Command line support (enigma --encrypt -mode=aes -infile=file outfil=...) 
- Support AES-GCM 
- Generate RSA Public & Private Keys
- Fix window on maximize, when dragging to centre it gets minimized
- Load resources asynchronously
